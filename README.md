# 🔥 Fire Fighting Robot using Arduino

## 📌 Project Description
The **Fire Fighting Robot** is an Arduino-based robotic system designed to detect and extinguish fire automatically.  
It uses **flame sensors** to identify fire and a **water pump** to spray water on the fire source, reducing the risk to human life.

This project demonstrates the application of **embedded systems, robotics, and automation** and is suitable for **academic and beginner-level robotics projects**.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Flame sensors continuously monitor the environment.  
2. When fire is detected, the Arduino processes the sensor signal.  
3. The robot moves towards the detected fire using DC motors.  
4. The relay module activates the water pump.  
5. Water is sprayed to extinguish the fire.  
6. After extinguishing, the robot stops automatically.
